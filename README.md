# BeKind

is a practical, versatile and collaborative application
between users, in which they show the nearby ATMs from where they are, also indicating if they are empty or not, to facilitate the choice of the ATM to be going to use and avoid a possible trip to one that does not have money.

## Why?
You have had to go to an ATM and run into the bad
luck that this one is without money? I would have
liked to be notified of the situation of the same, before
to go?
That is the problem to which it provides a solution and that is why
exists BeKind
## What does it do?
1. Indicate the closest Bac ATMs with respect to your current location using GPS.
2. Notify that ATMs do not have money so that other users rule out the possibility of going to it.
3. Show the time of the last modification that occurred in the cashier when changing its status to empt
